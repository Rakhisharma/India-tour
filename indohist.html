<h2 style="color:#00293D"><i><u><a>HISTORY</a></u></i></h2><h5>The Indus Valley has been home to a major civilisation since 2,500 BC when Hinduism rose to prominence through power-wielding priests. When Aryan invaders from the north pushed the Dravidians south, India began its multicultural life. Though the Aryans brought their own gods and traditions, they were eventually assimilated into the original caste system controlled by the priests around 900 BC. Buddhism arrived around 500 BC, condemning the entrenched caste system and driving the first of many wedges between the countless kings, princes and priests who controlled various parts of India.

Empires rose and fell while Buddhism and Hinduism competed for dominance. Hinduism revived itself during the first 500 years of the common era until the first Muslims arrived in the 10th century. Though outside empires tried to control the subcontinent, Hinduism remained the dominant religion.

In modern times, the Maratha Empire took over traditional Mughal territory, and the Maratha leaders were the last of the kings to rule until the arrival of the British in 1803. The East India Company had been trading in India since 1612 and became immensely rich off its resources. Thankfully they left the culture, traditions and religions alone to continue as they had for centuries.

By the turn of the 20th century, opposition to British colonial rule began to escalate. Gandhi arrived in 1915 promoting passive resistance. But it was really WWII that dealt the final blow to British colonialism. The nations next transition came when the Muslims and Hindus broke into two factions, which resulted in the creation of Pakistan.

India continues to progress with its democratic government currently led by Sonia Gandhi’s Congress Party. Tensions with Pakistan over Kashmir, the issue of the caste society, and its rise as a global power make India a fascinating country. Despite its modernisation, India holds tightly to its deep cultural and religious traditions. But it’s this tenacity that keeps it at the top of many travellers  short list of destinations.</h5></i>

<h2 style="color:#00293D"><i><u><a>WEATHER</h2></i></u></a><h5>India is such a huge country that all kinds of climate exist. The deserts in the north are bone dry while the Himalayan mountains icy cold. Assam is one of the wettest spots on earth, and the southern Kerala state rarely cools off. India has three seasons hot, rainy or cool. Where you travel determines what kind of weather you will experience, when you should go, and what you should pack.

The annual monsoon plays a big part in the weather throughout India. The hottest time of year is the summer, from April until June. The heat begins to build up in February, and by April temperatures regularly top 40C. Relief comes in May when the monsoon arrives, bringing afternoon thunderstorms. From June until October expect plenty of rain and humidity. This is India’s low travel season, but in the northern mountains it’s a wonderful time of year.

India’s high season is during the winter months of November to March, when temperatures are pleasantly warm in the central and southern regions but freezing in the north. This is when most tourists flock to the beaches of Goa or explore the deserts of Gujarat. An ideal time to travel in India is during September, October, March and April. Fewer travellers are around and the weather is accommodating. Since every region has its own climate, dress appropriately for where you plan to travel</h5>
<h2 style="color:#00293D"><i><u><a>INDIA TRAVEL GUIDE</h2></i></u></a><h5>India is a superlative country in almost every way. It continues to awe even seasoned return travellers with its extreme contrasts of class and colour, opulence and poverty, filth and beauty. This is the land of one of Humanity’s oldest and most fascinating cultures, where vast empty deserts melt into subtropical backwaters. India’s list of world-class sights, monuments, temples and cities is rivalled by few other nations on earth. Here, religion and class mix in a way that seems impossibly sustainable. Yet India has endured for millennia.

Don’t expect an easy ride when you visit India. Its ability to frustrate and annoy is equally matched by its reliability to amaze and humble. A little mental and emotional preparation is suggested before attempting to visit the home of more than one billion souls. India’s heart-wrenching poverty is impossible to ignore, and visitors will be confronted with it at every turn. Yet beyond the desperation lies a culture of true hospitality, regardless of class. Whether you want to soak in the ubiquitous spirituality, chill out on a beach, ride a camel though the Rajasthan desert sands or brave the streets of Mumbai or Old Delhi, India offers something for everyone.

It’s impossible to cover the entire subcontinent of India in one go. A wise traveller will choose a region or two and spend time absorbing each distinct subculture. The north is home to imposing fortresses, the snowy Himalayas and endless sand deserts of Gujarat and Rajasthan. The south has the wonderfully chilled-out Backwaters of Kerala, Tamil Nadu culture and lovely beaches along the Malabar coast. In between are marvels like the Taj Mahal, the Ganges River, Jodhpur’s Blue City, and the hill stations of Darjeeling.

Accommodation in India ranges from five-star palatial hotels set in castles and the like, to budget friendly hotels with a homely atmosphere. It pays to do book ahead before you go to ensure you get a room that suits your needs. No matter where you stay or when you visit India, it will leave an indelible impression on your soul. Just be prepared.</h5>
