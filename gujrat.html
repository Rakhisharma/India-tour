Due    to    its  close  proximity  to the sea, Gujarat has developed into a thriving economic state. Standing at the threshold of the 21st century, it has made giant leaps towards modernization. Predominantly a business class, the state is exploring newer areas like technology, infrastructure development and trade.

The arts and crafts too flourished due to the progress of trade and commerce in the past eight hundred years. Businesspersons largely patronized these crafts, helping them brave the vagaries of time. Even today, the traditional dress of Gujarat- the ghaghra-choli, and the famous tie and dye work is immensely popular throughout India. The folk dances of Guajrat, including the garba and dandia are so vibrant and graceful that it is no doubt captivating. 

Gujarat     is    also    a unique state with diverse habitats. Its varied land forms include the famous dry deciduous forests like the Gir (the only habitat of the Asiatic lion), majestic grass lands like those found at Velavadar and vast landscapes harboring rare animals in habitats like Rann of Kutch. Wetland habitats like Nalsarovar, marine ecosystems, are found near the Pirotan Islands and the rich moist deciduous forests of the Dangs are irresistible. 

Other tourist   attractions include, the sacred temples of Dwarka and Somnath; Palitana, the picturesque Mountain city of Jain temples at about 2,000 feet height on the Shetrunjaya hills; Udwada, the oldest place of the fire temple of the Parses in India; the 5,000 years old archaeological finds in Lothal and the 11th century Sun temple at Modhera among the architectural wonders.
