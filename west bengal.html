However, Darjeeling, the most popular hill station of the region, and its surrounding areas, prove a respite. Wonderfully cool, its landscape is aweinspiring. Here, the Himalayan Mountaineering Museum,Ghoom Buddhist Monastery and the Singlaa bazaar are major attractions. Kalimpong is another beautiful little town. The dawn breaking over Kanchenjunga, horse riding, tea gardens and treks, all the expectations of a hilly holiday are fulfilled. West Bengal, thus promises you both plains and mountain peaks.

The Eden Gardens stretching over acres of lush green grass is the famous cricket field. A two-day-one-night cruise to the mangrove forests of theSunderbans entails spending nights in a forest bungalow on stilts and the chance to see the Royal Bengal Tiger. Digha, the beach resort of Calcutta, is easily accessible by road and a wonderful getaway.
