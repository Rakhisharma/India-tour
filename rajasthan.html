<h3 style="color:#4C0000">Rajasthan Travel Guide</h3>
<h5><i>Rajasthan is a place where cities pink and gold have been built over ashes of the dead. Citadels and fortresses, palaces and ramparts have sprung up in between the sands of the Thar, the great Indian desert that stretches through the western half of Rajasthan. The desert lands are framed by the 700 km craggy heights of the Aravallis, cutting the land in half. To the east of the Aravallis, Rajasthan grows its cotton in an agriculturally rich alluvial soil. 

Rajasthan is a land of ornate architecture, decorative palaces, wide expanses of water and summer palaces on islands. The fortresses are steeped in memories: women who preferred mass suicide rather than fall into the hands of the enemy. Warrior clans are bound by inviolable codes of honour and chivalry; the Rajput pride and chivalry are a part of folklore.

In Jaipur, is the enchantingHawa Mahal, Jaipur Hawa Mahal or Palace of Winds, tier upon tier of curved arch surmounting fairy casements with ornamental screens. The imposing gate of the City Palace is guarded by stone elephants. At the entrance of the palace, stands the Jantar Mantar, the largest and best preserved observatories built by Maharaja Jaisingh. The Rambagh Palace once a royal home is now a fabulous hotel. Pushkar, site of the biggest cattle fair in Rajasthan, is a brief 14 km from Ajmer. Chittorgarh fort is remembered for its association with the saint princess Mirabai and Padmini's Palace a pavilion where Alauddin Khilji saw the glimpse of the princess. Rana Kumbha's Vijai Stumbh stands in memory of a solitary victory. TheSawai Madhopur forest retreat and the Ranthanhor sanctuary are major tourist attractions

Seen from outside, the sight must be almost identical to what was seen by merchants on their overland camel caravans to central Asia. Once this desert outpost was an important gate for the trade route, and Jaisalmer grew wealthy on the proceeds.</h5></i>
