	</h3><h5><i>		
Kerala is situated on the south-west coast of India, sandwiched between the Lakshwadeep Sea and the Western Ghats. The country is full of rice fields, mango and cashewnut trees and above all, coconut palms. Kerala is also an important center for spices and this has drawn merchants of spices to stop here. Its wide contact with the outside world has given the Malayalis (the natives of Kerala) their cosmopolitanism. This is also the state with the highest literacy rate.Kerala Dancer

Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, is a relaxed place and has a different culture from Kovalam or Varkala. There is, however, little in the way of 'sights' in the city. Kovalam, on the other hand, is a traditional Kerala village offering fresh fish, toddy and fruit and the ideal place for sun-bathing travelers. 

Varkala is an embryonic beach resort 41 km north of Thiruvananthapuram. The town and railway station are two km from the beach which lies beneath towering cliffs and boasts a mineral water spring. The Janardhana Temple is another tourist attraction. In the Western Ghats is the famous Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary. It has a nice lake and has opportunities to see wildlife at close quarters. In the Eravikulam National Park you can see the rare, but almost tame Nilgiri tahr. 

In northern Kerala, Cochin, St Francis Church is India's oldest European-built church. The remains of Vasco da Gama lies here. 
Kerala also gave birth to the dance form, Kathakali. It is a dance exclusively meant for men. It has as subject the battles between the gods and the demons and is dynamic and dramatic in character.
