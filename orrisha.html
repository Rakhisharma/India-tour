Each morning the sun breaks over the Konark temple, bringing to life one of the most beautiful states of India- Orissa. The Sun Temple, also known as the black pagoda, was constructed in the 13th century AD. It was conceived as a celestial chariot of the Sun God, drawn on 12 pairs of elaborately ornated wheels, driven by seven spirited horses. 

The temple, in its exceptional sense of proportion and its near perfect execution of postures of the icons, reflects the aesthetic and architectural vision of the people of the land. Blessed with the creativity of thousands of artists who have given expression to the miles of unspoilt coastline, lakes, ancient monuments, temples through their artisanship, Orissa is a land of plenty.
